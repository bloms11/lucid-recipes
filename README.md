# lucid-recipes
Lucid recipes is a simple web app that provides you with recipes from different parts of the world. Imagine you have a couple of ingredients but don't know what to prepare or you know what to prepare but don't know how to go about it. This project was designed to solve that problem. Spoonacular api was used in this project to fetch recipes as data which was passed into different componnts of the web. Thsis project was built from scratch in React.js. A search bar is made available, in which you can input any ingredient and recipes related to that ingridient would be displayed. Cool right? This is literally my first project with an API and it was quite fun working on it. Lol.
